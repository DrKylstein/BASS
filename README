Soundblaster with MPU-401 UART compatible interfaces.

Build this program with Open Watcom's wmake utility.
tablegen.cpp is a standalone program used to generate PC speaker note tables.

Currently only PC Speaker is supported as output, via MIDI channel 1.
Adlib has a temporary implementation for testing purposes.

Note that this program requires MPU401 input to operate and will not run 
under emulators that do not support this, such as DOSBox.
